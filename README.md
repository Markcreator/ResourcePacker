2) Run the command `pip install pillow`
3) Download and unzip [ResourcePacker.zip](https://github.com/Markcreator/ResourcePacker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
4) Find the resource pack you want to use and place its `block` folder (usually located in `assets/minecraft/textures/block`) into the same folder as where you unzipped `ResourcePacker.zip`
5) Run `pack.bat`
6) Take the generated `packed_image.png` image and upload it to a file service like Dropbox or Discord
7) Paste the URL of the uploaded image into the VRCraft
